				Sometimes a situation arises where we want to take the control to the beginning of the loop (for example for, while, do while etc.) skipping the rest statements inside the loop which have not yet been executed.

The keyword continue allow us to do this. When the keyword continue executed inside a loop the control automatically passes to the beginning of loop. Continue is usually associated with the if statement.
