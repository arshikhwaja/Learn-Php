				Sometimes a situation arises where we want to exit from a loop immediately without waiting to get back to the conditional statement.

The keyword break ends execution of the current for, foreach, while, do while or switch structure. When the keyword break executed inside a loop the control automatically passes to the first statement outside the loop. A break statement is usually associated with 
the if statement.
