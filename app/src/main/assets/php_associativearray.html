	Associative arrays are used to store key value pairs. For example, to store the marks of different subject of a student in an array, a numerically indexed array would not be the best choice. Instead, we could use the respective subjectâ€™s names as the keys in our associative array, and the value would be their respective marks gained.
	Traversing the Associative Array:
We can traverse associative arrays using loops. We can loop through the associative array in two ways. First by using for loop and secondly by using foreach.
