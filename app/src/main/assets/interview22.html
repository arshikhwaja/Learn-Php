				The foreach loop is mainly used for looping through the values of an array. It loops over the array, and each value for the current array element is assigned to $value, and the array pointer is advanced by one to go the next element in the array.
				<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Syntax:<br>
				&nbsp &nbsp &nbspforeach (array as $value)<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp{ 
				&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp//code to be executed; <br>
				&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp}
